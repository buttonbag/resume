** Your Resume Critique **

Katie Warren November 19, 2019 to me

This free resume evaluation is intended to give you an honest, straightforward assessment with some suggestions to help in your job search. I personally review hundreds of resumes each month so I'm able to provide insight into how you compare to other job seekers competing for the same positions.
Visual Presentation and Organization

We’ve all been told that looks don’t matter as much as substance, but in the case of your resume this just isn’t true. I found your design to be visually uneven. The appearance is not polished, and it doesn’t say "high potential" as your experience suggests. Remember that your resume is your marketing tool. It’s the first impression a potential employer has of you.

However, your use of bullets is splendid! They help the employer zero in on important pieces of information, and also break up long sections of text. At the same time, you shouldn't have too many bullets that it makes your resume difficult to read!
Resume Writing

You need a career summary section to define you as a professional and cover those areas most relevant to your career level and job target. A career summary should provide hiring managers with a brief, yet detailed synopsis of what you bring to the table.

From the way the resume is worded, you come across as a "doer," as opposed to an "achiever." Too many of your job descriptions are task-based and not results-based. This means that they tell what you did, instead of what you achieved. This is a common mistake for non-professional resume writers. To be effective and create excitement, a great resume helps the hiring executive picture you delivering similar achievements at his or her company. Here are some examples of task-based sentences in your resume:

    “Assists in design and layout development”
    “Designed, coded and modified landing pages”

Employers want to know about your previous contributions and specifically how you’ve made a difference. More importantly, they want to know how you are going to make a significant difference at their company.

When I read your resume, I did not find the kind of compelling language that would bring your work to life. Instead, I saw passive words and non-action verbs.

Phrases like “responsibilities include” and “Assists in” are overused, monotonous, and add little value to your resume. Strong action verbs, used with compelling language to outline exemplary achievements, are essential parts of a well-constructed resume.

Now, let’s put it all together. Here’s a real life example taken from a former client’s resume. By changing the language, we helped to improve the perception of the candidate.

    Passive language / Doing: “Negotiated contracts with vendors”
    Action language / Achieving: “Slashed payroll/benefits administration costs 30% by negotiating pricing and fees, while ensuring the continuation and enhancements of services.”

** A change like this makes a dramatic improvement. **

It may not seem obvious, but a regular review of every word and sentence in your resume is a good idea. Hiring managers are looking for an excuse to eliminate you as a candidate. You may not be able to see awkward phrases and grammatical errors if you've already spent a lot of time with your own resume.

** Digital Readiness **

Your resume is saved in PDF format. 19% of resumes look like yours. While this may make viewing consistent for recruiters, some older applicant tracking systems (ATS) have problems reading them. If you have the ability, you might consider saving your document in Microsoft Word format for some online submissions.

** Resume Scan Test Results **

93% of all Hiring Managers use resume scanning software called applicant tracking systems (ATS) to filter candidates from the application pool. To illustrate how you stand up to the automation, I passed your resume through the very same software that Hiring Managers use to filter the real talent from the hundreds, sometimes thousands, of candidates that apply for a single open position.
